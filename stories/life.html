Mom?" I ask, lying in bed, snuggled under my bright blue blanket.

"What is it honey?" my mother replied, as she sat down at the foot of my bed, like a warm protective light, keeping me on the right track.

"What if..." I stop for a second, considering what I am going to say. "What if God is not all powerful... what if there is more... what if the universe is filled with magical powers! And, and there's people stronger! What if... what if gods watch over planets, and someone watches over galaxies, and someone watches over the universe!" My mother smiled warmly at me, she must have thought I was crazy, be she supported me my ideas all the way.

"Oh honey! You have quite the imagination..." she walks over, as quiet as a mouse, and kisses my forehead goodnight. And like a shadow, she floats out the door, closing it behind her. How naive I was, but I was damn smart; because I was dead on.

planet get engulfed from the window. The only thing I could before we had to go was get dressed, my sister managed to bring her stuffed teddy called "ickasaskat-tacklact" you probably won't understand that, it's my native language "Everan."

"It's okay Alice..." I say to her through gritted teeth, trying not to breakdown right there. "At least we have each other..." I choke out; as I stand there, a single tear flows down my cheek. Suddenly, I see a large man in a suit walk up to me and my sister, his shiny black shoes tap on the floor with each step he takes.

"Hello, you must be Rin Agwaskesk" and you are Alice Agwaskesk"

he speaks so fast and sharp we don't have room to chime in. "I'm from the C.C.C, Child Care Commision, and we are going to take care of you now!" He wears a warm welcoming smile, but I didn't trust him, I had seen through his mask; we should have ran when we had the chance. "You young lady, are going to the all new, and best, druid camp there is! Where you'll learn everything about magic!" the man said, my sisters' eyes sparkled in wonder for a second, then reverted to her worried and scared look.

"What about brother... can he come to?" She replied, her voice muffled from her hiding behind my back. "Oh, I'm sorry, the camp only allows girls, boys cannot be druids" the man said, his voice cold and hard like a stone.

"W-What about brother...?" My sister said, her voice shaky, almost as shaky as her whole body was in the moment.

"He'll have to go to the orphanage with the other boys," the man said. Little did I know that was the last time I would ever see my sister again, I remember the moment so vividly, it tears me apart. Suddenly, a woman grabbed my sister, while the man pulled me in the other direction.

"Let me go!" I screamed, I was pulling away from his cold icy grasp as hard as I could, but it was no use. The only thing I could think of doing at that moment was hold onto my sister. But she was almost out of reach, I grabbed her Teddybear, hoping it would hold us together, just a little longer. The moment felt like it lasted a lifetime, I looked into Alice's tear-filled eyes, the woman, and the man pulling us apart, we both knew that was the last time we'd ever see each other again.

That was so long ago now, and it still haunts me; I still look for her, hoping that one day, I'll find her, I'll finally be reunited. Eden, that's what they decided to call the main city on the new planet, it's the farthest thing from Eden. Rampant crime, Magic misuse, Constant murders, it would be better if they just left us there, to die. That Orphanage that I was sent to was horrid. Beatings, torture, forced magic training, we weren't allowed to leave. As I said, we learned magic, I was the best at Telekinesis, I managed to make myself float away from my problems, but nowhere far enough. So here I am now, sitting in my dingy apartment, slowly crippling away.

The world changed in the wake of the Celestial victory. The skies, once ruled by the winds, now belonged to the light. The Zephyr Lords became a distant memory, their power fading into legend.

But in the quiet places of the world, where the wind still whispered through the trees and the storms still rumbled in the distance, some say that Aurora Stars still lives. They tell stories of a warrior with wings of wind and a broken sword, wandering the verse in search of a way to reclaim her home.

Her legend lives on, a reminder of a time when the wind and the stars fought for control of the heavens. And though the Celestials may rule the skies now, the wind still carries the memory of Aurora Stars, and her fight for freedom.

I heard a knock at the door, who could it be? It could be the landlord coming to finally kick me out, I haven't worked in years, there is no point; I'm surprised I'm still here. I slowly creep my way to the door, making sure I don't make a sound. I can't lose this apartment, not again.

As I reached the door, I gently put my ear to it, as quiet as a mouse.I don't hear anything. Maybe they left, but maybe they're standing there, waiting for me to mess up. After a moment, I cave in and open the door just a creek, gently lighting my apartment from the slit in the door. "Hello?" I murmur, my voice void of emotion.

"Hey jerk! Thanks for leaving me waiting! I had some extra dinner, and since I know you're tight on money. I thought... I'd give you some..." I know that bubbly happy go lucky voice anywhere.

"Hey Edith... thanks..." Edith is my next-door neighbor, she doesn't make much noise, and I don't talk to anyone very often, so I don't know her too well. "You're welcome! Here!" She holds the small plate of food up in front of her. Edith seems to always be happy, despite the terrible living conditions of this building. I take the plate of food cautiously, still unsure of her random kindness. "So,,, any luck...?" Edith says, her smile fading into a more serious yet sorrowful face.

"No..." I say, my face is still a void of emotion, but I can still feel the sorrow in my tone. I start to close the door, the fresh steaming pile of food in my hand; before the door fully closes, Edith adds. "Okay... See you around..." I choose not to respond. I go and sit at my little table I bought with the scrapings I pulled together, the food isn't that bad, it's good, really good! Edith isn't a bad cook, nor a bad person, maybe I should be nicer to her. Well, whatever the case, it's time to go search for her, I must keep looking, anything, anyone, i have to find my sister.

A few minutes later I put on my shoes, if you could still call them shoes, and start my daily search. I've looked everywhere, Shelters, Camps, that snobby Druid camp she was forced to go to, but she was nowhere, she was like a ghost. I pass stores, people's little hope of life in this unfair city. There's a small corner store in the middle of town, it's small, but nice; I know the owner well, Bruce. Bruce is a nice man, he's always nice to me, despite how I am to him usually; I usually go to his store to buy food, because it's cheap. He usually gives me returns or anything that is too old to sell by itself. I walk in, and like always, his store is empty, full shelves, yet no one comes through for this poor man's livelihood. "I've... got some news for ya..." Bruces tone wasn't one I've heard before, it was serious, but with a hint of remorse. "I found her..." he choked out the words, as if he didn't want to tell me. My heart skipped a beat and I nearly jumped back in shock, could it really be? "Really! Where!" I probed, my voice full of emotion for this first time in a decade, hoping that my search was finally, finally over. Bruce gave me directions to her location; I ran as fast as my legs could take me towards her location, finally I found her, my search was over, my little sister would finally be safe!

And sure enough, there she was; Alice Agwaskesk, year 0000 to 0003, she didn't make it to 10 years old. She was dead, I dropped to my knees, looking at the tombstone with her name written in stone, her fate sealed. I sat there, looking at the old wallet photo that I had of her. As I release from my shaky grasp, it drifts off, the wind carrying it away, along with my hope for the future. 21 years, she's been gone 21 years, I got no alert, no notice, like I didn't even matter. I laid there with her for what seemed like hours, considering joining her, finally reuniting us. But I decided to stay, I was too weak to end it all, maybe just a little longer here, in the horrible world. As I walk home, there isn't a drop of hope nor happiness left in my shattered soul. I get home and plop down on my couch, done with all of this,

it was all over, all of it was over. I hear a knock at the door, I bumble over and I open it, not caring if it were someone that was going to run in and kill me, it wouldn't bother me if someone did. "I... Believe this belongs to you..." Edith says, holding out the wallet photo of my sister. I grabbed it from her, wondering if she returned it to hurt me more, why would she give this back to me?

"I'm... Sorry about what happened..." Edith Says, here face down tone. A faint smile grows on my face, the suppressed tears finally flowing free. "Thank you..." I return, maybe,maybe life isn't so bad.
